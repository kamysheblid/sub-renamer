* sub-renamer
  A python program to automatically rename subtitle files to their
  corresponding video filenames.

  It does this by using regex to find similar season and episode
  numbers, filters the subtitles to filenames containing the episode
  number, looks for the closest subtitle using the Levenshtein
  distance function, and then changing the subtitle name to that same
  video file name but with its subtitle extension.
