* sub-renamer
  A python program to automatically rename subtitle files to their
  corresponding video filenames.

  It does this by parsing season and episode numbers using regex to
  find similar season and episode numbers for subtitles and videos,
  then renames the subtitle filenames to matching video filenames.

  If the first method fails it can use an optional dependency to find
  the Levenshtein distance between video and subtitle filenames to
  attempt to match them.
